     What’s happening here is quite complex: when we use withAnimation(), SwiftUI immediately changes our state property to its new value, but behind the scenes it’s also keeping track of the changing value over time as part of the animation. As the animation progresses, SwiftUI will set the animatableData property of our shape to the latest value, and it’s down to us to decide what that means – in our case we assign it directly to insetAmount, because that’s the thing we want to animate.

        get { insetAmount }
        set { self.insetAmount = newValue }

        var path = Path()

        path.move(to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: rect.maxY))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: insetAmount, y: rect.minY))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - insetAmount, y: rect.minY))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX, y: rect.maxY))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: rect.maxY))

        return path
